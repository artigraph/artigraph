#   - Perhaps a lot of the _build_producer logic can live in a few Producer methods. We
#   still want to expose each partition-to-build as a parallelizable unit of execution,
#   so maybe one Producer method kicks out all to-be-built partitions+metadata, and then
#   Executor can parallelize the `.build`.
